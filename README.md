# Hi, I'm Å arÅ«nas Å iaudÅ¾ionis ðŸ‘‹ 
### A Web Developer passionate about building beautiful and functional websites.

For over 10 years, I've been helping businesses and individuals establish their online presence by building, customizing, and managing websites with WordPress. This experience has given me a deep understanding of the entire project lifecycleâ€”from client consultation and design to deployment and maintenance. Building on this solid foundation, I have recently pivoted my focus to modern, full-stack JavaScript development. After completing comprehensive training, I am now deepening my expertise in **React** and am passionate about building more dynamic, scalable, and interactive applications from the ground up.

## My Live Projects 
Here are a few websites I have built and deployed. My role in these projects involved everything from  initial setup to customization and launch.
